Just my copy of [microajax](http://code.google.com/p/microajax/) by Stefan Lange-Hegermann.  

I only gave this repo a different name to avoid confusion. You should not use my version, get the original which was developed and is maintained by someone who actually knows what they're doing. I on the other hand, am a Javascript novice pretending to know what he's doing.

**Lailai** is basically "Little" in Fijian.
