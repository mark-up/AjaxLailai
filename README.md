Just my copy of [microajax](http://code.google.com/p/microajax/) by Stefan Lange-Hegermann.  

I gave this repo a different name to avoid confusion. You probably shouldn't use my version; get the original which was developed and is maintained by someone who actually knows what they're doing.

*Lailai* is is Fijian for 'little'.
